    "# Robot Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to develop a robot navigation algorithm that can process robot's sensor data to generate robot navigation commands to fulfill the given objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this toy problem, we have a differential driver robot with the following sensors:\n",
    "- Camera (with depth sensing)\n",
    "- Laser distance sensing\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: we want to write a program that can guide the robot to score goals!\n",

    "Environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can first develop our algorithm in a simulation environment:  \n",
